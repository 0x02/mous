1.This port is based on MACLib SDK 4.11,
and it still follows its original license(means Monkey's audio's license).

2.The *.asm file under MACLib/Assembly/ 
still follows its original license(means the license of mac3.99).

3.If [2] does not compatible with [1], let me know that!
I will totally *remove* [2], and *rewite* that assembly codes by myself.
Acturlly, as for me, *any* license is fine, I just want to decode ape!Please!Thanks!
